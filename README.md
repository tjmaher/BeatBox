# BeatBox

Code provided by Head First Java, in their BeatBox application.

Modification by T.J. Maher:
 * Separated the instrument keys and instruments placing them in the enum Instruments.java
 *  Made the program flexible to recognize how many instruments were listed, in 'Instrument.values().length' 
    so by editing the enum file, we can add or change the instruments.
 * Created a listener for the instrument checkboxes, so the new beat would play instantly, instead of waiting 
   for the user to press 'Start'
 * Changed the GUI a bit
